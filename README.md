# Housing Data Analysis for Repair Job Estimation

## Overview

This project aims to analyze housing repair job data to estimate the time required to finish a repair job based on various features such as Work Order Number (WO #), Requested Date, Task Closed Date, Finish Date, Estimated Completion Date, Facility, Building, Area, Department, Task Code-Description, Contractor, Status, Project, Project Name, Request, Due Date, Work Order Type Description, Work Order Task Posted Hours, Chargeable Status, and Item SubLocation.

## Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to identify patterns and insights that can help in accurately estimating the time required to complete housing repair jobs. This can aid in efficient planning and scheduling of repair tasks, optimizing resource allocation, and improving overall operational efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**
  - Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of repair job data.
  
- **Feature Engineering**
  - Creation of new features or transformations to better represent the data and improve predictive performance.
  
- **Predictive Modeling**
  - Development of predictive models to estimate the time required to finish repair jobs based on selected features.
  
- **Model Evaluation**
  - Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
